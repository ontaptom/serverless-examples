# Serverless Examples

This repository contains a collection of serverless application examples that can be deployed on Google Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, or even Kubernetes (K8s). These examples are used in tutorials published on the [storagefreak website](https://www.storagefreak.net) and the [storagefreak YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@storagefreak).

## Structure
